// Period 5

/**
* This project needs to be a bake sale in which
* super heros use their super powers to bake cakes
* to raise money for the PTA.
*
* It must include custom types for the following:
* - SuperHero
* - Cake
* - Store
* - Customer
*
* In your Main class, you must create:
* - at least 2 hero instances
* - at least 2 customer instances
* - at least 1 store instance
* - at least 3 cake instances
*
* Both customers must buy a Cake at a store 
*   so the store can raise money for the PTA.
* Neither customer can spend 
*   more money than they have.
* The hero must get better at making cakes 
*   with each cake they make
* Better cakes are made by better cake makers 
*   and sell for more money than worse cakes
*
* You may use the Turtle object or not
* You may create a PTA type or not
* The store must raise 1 MILLION DOLLARS!
* You should use a "FOR" loop
* You may use Arrays
